        <p>Resistance fighters led by General Leia Organa evacuate their base when a First Order fleet arrives. In an effective but costly counterattack led by Poe Dameron, Resistance fighters manage to destroy a First Order dreadnought. The Resistance vessels
            jump into hyperspace but the First Order pursue them using a tracking device. Kylo Ren, Leia's son, destroys the Resistance support fighters, but hesitates to fire at the lead Resistance ship, after sensing his mother's presence. However,
            TIE fighters destroy the bridge of the ship, killing several Resistance leaders and incapacitating Leia. Command falls to Vice Admiral Holdo. Disapproving of Holdo's passive strategy, with the support of Poe, Finn, BB-8, and mechanic Rose
            Tico embark on a secret mission to disable the tracking device.</p>
